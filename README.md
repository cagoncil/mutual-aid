This app is for everyone (regardless of gender identity) whose lives are affected by the repeal of Roe v. Wade, either: 
- **_directly_** (health-wise physically, financially, occupationally, socially, geographically, etc.) or, 
- **_indirectly_** (emotionally, mentally, behaviorally, geographically, politically, etc.). 

Individuals, nation-wide, are harmed by the June repeal of Roe v. Wade. This Supreme Court ruling will lead to disastrous, unintended consequences for our nation, with a disparate negative impact upon AFAB individuals, Black and Brown communities, impoverished communities, rural towns, and young people. Community-oriented, nation-wide policy and grassroots responses are imperative, and technology offers additional solutions to a complicated problem. Chiefly, technology improves access of all kinds (information, communication, collaboration, safe and healthy options), and this app will hopefully be one of many to come as we enter this new way of life.

The **aim** of this project is to improve information access, safe reproductive healthcare access, personal decision making ability, and long term life outcomes for all, as well as to facilitate interpersonal communication and expand community participation and civic engagement in the midst of a public health crisis.

I think this is a **huge** passion project for me and would be very honored if this project was approved. I'm very passionate about expanding healthcare access to under-resourced and historically marginalized individuals and communities.
